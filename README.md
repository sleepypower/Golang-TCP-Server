# Golang-TCP-Server

Implementation of a TCP-SERVER using Golang

## Usage

### Run Server
```cmd
cd server
go run main.go
```
Allow access to Windows Defender Firewall
This will allow the server.go to list to localhost:8080

There are 5 Clients, but you can create more!
```cmd
cd client'Number'
go run client.go
```

There are currently implemented the following commands HELP SEND SUB USERNAME CHNLS MSG
